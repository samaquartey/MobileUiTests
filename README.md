# MobileUiTests
# Mobile UI & API tests app used Missguided APK - Android device only
# Notes:
For API
I was able to procy to device using fiddler or chalese but not able to get trafic from app, only mobile browser worked, tried to decompile and add custome certs to app but still no win due to some missing files in the apk
but was of no good so api is just a demo based on mobile browsers rather than app.

For UI.
All was done, its just a case of having device name replaced and the test should still pass with the app launch to close.

# To run test use runner class and change tags to run specific tests or use pom xml also requires tags.
